# OCS3

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gemini-hlsw/ocs3.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/gemini-hlsw/ocs3)

This project aims to build the next generation Observatory Control System (OCS). At the time of this writing, only the Seqexec has been integrated. This setup has the following goals

- Adhere to the simplest possible sbt structure.
- No need for OSGi
- Use managed dependencies
- Support of web applications using scala.js
- Testing supported on both JVM and JS backends

## Structure
The project contains a single `modules` subtree. Inside that module each of the bundles is located. Web applications are further devided internally to have the server side, client side and shared code compiled to their respective backends

```
ocs3/
 |
 +-- modules/
 |    |
 |    +-- edu.gemini.seqexec.server/
 |    +-- edu.gemini.seqexec.shared/
 |    +-- edu.gemini.seqexec.web/
 |           |
 |           +-- edu.gemini.seqexec.web.shared/
 |           +-- edu.gemini.seqexec.web.server/
 |           +-- edu.gemini.seqexec.web.client/
 +-- app/
```
`app` contains build.sbt definitions for deployable applications

## Settings

Settings and module versions are defined in the file `project/Settings.scala`

## Testing

`ScalaTest` has been chosen as the test framework since it works in both scala.js and jvm. `ScalaCheck` is also supported running with `ScalaTest`.
Sample tests using `scalatest` and `scalacheck` are included in some modules. You can run `test` at the root level or on a module basis.

Note that IDEA doesn't support running tests on scala.js. See this [issue](https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/743)

To tests the javascript side you need to install node and jsdom. In OSX using `brew` you can do:

```
brew install node
```

From the ocs3 project root directory:
```
npm install jsdom
```

Alternatively, if you already have jsdom globally installed you can make it visible to ocs3 by linking it. From the ocs3 project root directory:
```
npm link jsdom
```

`node` should be at least on version `0.6.x`, check it with `node --version` once installed

## IDEA

Before opening the project in IDEA, run a top-level compile at least once to generate code that will be picked up by IDEA

IDEA can open directly the project's sbt. Go to

```
File -> Open
```

And find the file `ocs/build.sbt`. IDEA should show a dialog box to import the project. You may need to select the appropriate JVM version (1.8) and IDEA will import the project.
`sbt` files may have highlight errors due to this [bug](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/SCL-9599). Otherwise, sbt import seems to work quite well.

**Note:** Sbt import in IDEA changes very often. This has been tested on IDEA C 2016.1 and the Scala plugin version 3.0

**Note:** If you need to re-generate the project, delete the `.idea` folder
